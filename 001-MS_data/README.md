# MS Data



This sub folder contains scripts relating to data acquisition or the search of acquired mass spectra.  

**Library-Prediction @ 55106f6** is a fork to a workflow (written by Jason Derks) for predicting Ion Mobilities (IM) for FASTA digest based spectral libraries which are outputted by DIA-NN. More specifically, for predicting accurate IMs for peptides labelled with mTRAQ.  


**bayesPG_pSCoPESetupExample.R** is a script for generating tiered inclusion lists for the implementation of prioritized SCoPE acquisition via MaxQuant Live. The current script processes report files of DIA acquisitions outputted by DIANN. The file paths listed in the script correspond to the processed data folder directory structure that can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oMaW74bjDPPPjyPTqocPD_SjMnHy7UeM?usp=sharing)
