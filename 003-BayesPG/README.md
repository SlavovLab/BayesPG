# BayesPG



This sub folder contains scripts relating to the implementation of BayesPG and processing of BayesPG outputs. 

**ptr_testes @ fbf4b4e** is a fork to the main repository (written and maintained by Megan Elcheikhali) for BayesPG. The repository outlines all the different scripts and their purposes in its README. 


**bayesPG_fig4_respChain.R** is fairly self explanatory mini script to produce figure 4 from the manuscript. It uses the rPTR test table (at the level of GO terms). The file paths listed in the script correspond to the processed data folder directory structure that can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oMaW74bjDPPPjyPTqocPD_SjMnHy7UeM?usp=sharing)
